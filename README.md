# Website-Project-2
A Website Called 'AK Website' Is A Platform to Sell Digital Products Online. I used HTML, CSS, Icon library from Font Awesome and normalize.css v8.0.1 its A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets. Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
