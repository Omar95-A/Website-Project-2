# Website Project 2

> A Website Called 'AK Website' Is A Platform to Sell Digital Products Online. I used HTML, CSS, Icon library from Font Awesome and normalize.css v8.0.1 its A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets. Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.

#### To try the website: [Demo](https://omar95-a.github.io/Website-Project-2/).

For work on this website i used Kasper - One Page Creative PSD Template which I took sketch from the [Graphberry](https://www.graphberry.com/item/kasper-one-page-psd-template) website.
I learned how can i use the html & css professionally in design the websites with Eng. Osama Elzero
