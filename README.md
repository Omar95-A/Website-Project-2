# Website-Project-2
Website Named 'AK Website'. I used HTML, CSS, Icon library from Font Awesome and normalize.css v8.0.1 its A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets. Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.

## To try the website: 
For work on this website i used Kasper - One Page Creative PSD Template which I took sketch from the Graphberry website. https://www.graphberry.com/item/kasper-one-page-psd-template
I learned how can i use the html & css professionally in design the websites with Eng. Osama Elzero https://elzero.org/

## Special Thanks To Osama Elzero
